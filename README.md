# Beef-Cattle-
Dataset for beef cattle using SQL and Power BI

INTRODUCTION 

The research primarily targets beef cattle of various sexes, ages, and farm hectare sizes. In contrast to poultry and swine, beef cattle are exceptional in that they can produce high-quality protein for humans from low-quality forages. Due to beef's alleged detrimental effects on the environment, there has recently been an increase in pressure to limit production of the meat on a global scale. The production of food for humans relies heavily on beef cattle, which graze on a variety of forages and vast tracts of both tame and natural pasturelands. According to the dataset, beef cattle inhabit larger farmlands than smaller farms, however this is not necessary for small, beginning farmers; instead, small farms need to be employed to generate more beef cattle.

STEPS

1.To import the dataset into the MYSQL server, the dataset's xsl file was converted to a csv file.
2.The dataset's csv file was imported into a database that was built in the MYSQL server.
3.To delete the rows and drop the column, use the delete clause and drop column, accordingly.
4.The "Get data" option in Power BI was used to import the MySQL results.
5.To verify that the data is correct and okay, each of the MYSQL data results was changed using the data transformation option.
6.If the relationships are not satisfactory, the data modelling settings are checked and adjusted.
8.Making a dashboard for the data utilizing various visuals, including filters, cards, text boxes, and clustered bar charts, in order to identify trends and extract insights from the dataset
