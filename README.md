Dataset for beef cattle using SQL and Power BI


The research primarily targets beef cattle of various sexes, ages, and farm hectare sizes. In contrast to poultry and swine, beef cattle are exceptional in that they can produce high-quality protein for humans from low-quality forages. Due to beef's alleged detrimental effects on the environment, there has recently been an increase in pressure to limit production of the meat on a global scale. The production of food for humans relies heavily on beef cattle, which graze on a variety of forages and vast tracts of both tame and natural pasturelands. According to the dataset, beef cattle inhabit larger farmlands than smaller farms, however this is not necessary for small, beginning farmers; instead, small farms need to be employed to generate more beef cattle.
